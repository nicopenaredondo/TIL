### Flux Challenge


2 days ago, I was trying to create a simple application with ReactJS and i was able to finish it within 1 day. Now, I'm currently applying Flux pattern (soon to be Redux) and it is all going well despite of the challenges that i've encounter during the dev't. I love the "aha" feeling whenever I figure out something that was bugging me on the first day that i've seen it. lo:l
