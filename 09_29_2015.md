# TIL : Basics of ReactJs

Started learning ReactJS today and learned a lot, Below are some of the terms that I need to familiarize to help me with my reactjs development.

1. JSX
2. Virtual DOM
3. React.createClass
4. React.render
5. State
6. getInitialState
7. props
8. propTypes
9. getDefaultProps
10. Component Life Cycle
 - componentWillMount
 - componentDidMount
 - componentWillReceiveProps
 - componentWillUnmount
11. Events
 - onClick
 - onSubmit
 - onChange

I still need to repeat the whole process just to be comfortable with the new js framework. There's still a lot of learning to do but I'm willing to take small teps to master it.
